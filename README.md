# Web Quality/Metric Extension Pack (QPack)

### QPack

Web Quality/Metric Development Essentials Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code

> These are some of my favorite extensions which helped me to keep to check the quality of my code.

**Notes**:
-  To enable `Sonar lint`, you have to install `java runtime environment(jre)`, which it will ask to download it when it has been installed.

- You can use [Tech Debt Metrics](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stepsize.tech-debt-tracker) as an alternative to `CodeMetrics` metric checker(But it is heavy).

- 2- [CodeMetrics](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kisstkondoros.vscode-codemetrics) - Computes complexity in TypeScript / JavaScript files.
